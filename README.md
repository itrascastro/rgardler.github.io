A Jekyll powered blog. Mostly this content is for my own records, just in case I need to come back to it in the future. Others might find some posts useful as they record the results of my research and experimetnation in software. 

It's more likely that someone would want to pick up my Jekyll and Bootstrap confguration. This was kick started by [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) but since that is unmaintained and I don't want to spend all my time generalizing the design it quickly moved away to a custom config for my own site.

I welcome contributions to both content and configuration, though in reality I dont's expect to see any.
